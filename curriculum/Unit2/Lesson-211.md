Options
-------
Classroom teachers have access to the College Board's AP CS A Personal Progress Checks.  With the completion of Unit 2 of the TEALS curriculum the College Board's Unit 1 "Primitive Types" Personal Progress Check can be used as formative assesement to test student understanding.  Students will need to sign in to their [College Board AP Classroom] accounts.  Note the College Board states the their assessments should not be used for grading purposes however you can give a participation grade for completion. The classroom teacher has a choice of using [WS 2.11], the College Board's Personal Progress Check, or some combination of the two.  The choice would depend on the time alloated for the review period.


Procedure
---------
Engage the class in the review session by pointing out that your review topics have been hand
selected by the class. Explain that you will review test-taking strategies in addition to reviewing
subject matter.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]


### Introduction and Test Format Orientation \[15 minutes\]

1. Clearly indicate that you expect all students to have a list of review topics to study this
   evening. Periodically remind students that this list will be checked at the end of class.

2. Students should already be familiar with the sections of the test, but it doesn’t hurt to have
   students re-read the directions.

3. Work through the sample problems on the test as a way of reviewing topics, and answer any
   questions that students bring up as you go.
   
4. Have students log into the [College Board AP Classroom] and take the Unit 1 Personal Progress Check.

### Test Review \[30 minutes\]

1. Using the results from the electronic survey, address the various review topics, prioritizing
   questions that popped up the most.

   a. Some questions you may already have addressed while working through the sample test.

   b. Be ready for additional questions to pop up as you go. Save yourself the work and use old
      homework questions and student-generated test questions as examples to work through.

   c. Jot down notes about which topics you covered in review so you can adjust the exam to reflect
      the topics your students have learned.

2. Use a combination of group-solving questions on the whiteboard, think-pair-share, and
   timed-response as review strategies.

3. After you’ve completed reviewing an idea, remind the class that they should write down that topic
   if they feel they still have to review it tonight. (Yes, this will be a reminder every few minutes,
   but it will pay off later when students start creating review lists without prompting later in the
   year!)

### Check student study lists \[5 minutes\]
Spend the last 5 minutes of class checking each student’s review topic list.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classes, you may want to change code-writing questions to Parsons Problems. Educational
research shows a high correlation between Parsons scores and code writing scores, and a low
correlation between code writing and tracing and between Parsons and tracing. (In other words,
Parsons Problems accurately assess a students’ ability to create code.) For more information on
Parsons Problems, check out this paper (<https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa08/cse599/denny.pdf>).


Even in a non-ELL class, you may want to change some Section II questions to Parsons problems
because (1) grading the questions is easier, since logic and syntax errors are easy to discern, and
(2) students challenged by language processing are able to more quickly complete the problem.

If your students are easily completing the programming projects in the week leading to the test, you
may want to edit the test by deleting the “fill in the blanks” and leaving empty space.
