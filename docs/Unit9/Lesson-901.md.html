Run a Mock AP CS A Exam

It is important for students to be familiar with the exam format before taking any AP exam.

Run an Mock AP CS A exam by logging into the College Board CS Classroom and download one of released AP Exam.

The logistics of filling out the form can be done on a separate day so it does not take up time when students are answer the questions.

Break up the exam into parts that fits into your school schedule.  

Ideally the multiple choice would be completed in one day and the free response on another.
You may need to break each part in half depending on your class meeting time.
